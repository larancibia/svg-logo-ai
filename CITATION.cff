title: "LLM-QD Logo System: Large Language Model Guided Quality-Diversity for Logo Generation"
version: 1.0.0
date-released: 2025-11-27
abstract: "A novel system combining Large Language Models with Quality-Diversity algorithms for automated SVG logo generation. Features 4D behavioral characterization, semantic mutation operators, RAG-enhanced evolution, and natural language query interface. Achieves 4-7.5x better diversity coverage while maintaining quality (85-90 fitness scores)."
